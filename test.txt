Redux
-----
//first we need to create a slice here 'cartSlice'
//import {createSlice} from 'reduxjs/toolkit'

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:'cart',
    initialState:{
        cartList: [],
        total: 0
    },
    reducers:{
        add(state , action){

        },
        remove(state, action){

        }
    }
})

//then we need to export them

export const {add , remove} = cartSlice.actions; //here we are importing it to use it throughout our project

export const cartReducer = cartSlice.reducer; //here we are exporting it to register it on our store.js

-------------

store.js
-------
import {configureStore} from 'reduxjs/toolkit'


//here we are exporting to use it in our provider

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer:{ //here reducer acts as a storage for all our reudcers
        cartState: cartReducer
    }
})


//finally in our index.js we import {store} from './store/store.js then import {Provider} from 'react-redux' then wrap our app in <Provider></Provider> then pass the storage
  like this <Provider store= {store}></Provider>


-------------------------------------------------
//useSelector()

const products = useSelector((state)=> state.cartState.cartList) //it takes a function and here we chose the state in our store inside reducer

//useDispatch

const dispatch = useDispatch()

//we use this when we pass a func/method in button we wrap the method with dispatch
